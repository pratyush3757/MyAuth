The repository is only intended to be a proof-of-concept.

This is a C++ 2FA token generator with runtime memory encryption. Is compatible with existing TOTP/HOTP implementations like Google Athenticator, Twilio Authy, etc.
It uses [Crypto++](https://www.cryptopp.com/) library for encryption, [CMake](https://cmake.org) for build and [GoogleTest](https://github.com/google/googletest) for testing.

A GUI frontend is available [here](https://github.com/pratyush3757/qtAuth).
